Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, about 3 minutes less than package directions.

Meanwhile, cook garlic and ¼ cup oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is golden, about 4 minutes. Add anchovies (if using) and red pepper flakes and cook, smashing anchovies with a wooden spoon to break them up, until anchovies begin to dissolve, about 1 minute.

Using tongs, transfer pasta to pot with garlic and anchovies, then add butter, ¾ cup Parmesan, 1¼ cups pasta cooking liquid, and lots of black pepper. Cook, tossing energetically and adding more pasta cooking liquid if needed, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and coats pasta, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in parsley, lemon zest, and lemon juice.

Divide pasta among bowls; drizzle with oil and top with more Parmesan.
